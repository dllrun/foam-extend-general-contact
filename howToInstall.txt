Before installation,

1. Get the source code: 
- Go to home directory in your terminal using,
  cd ~
- Make a directory,
  mkdir foam
  cd foam
  git clone https://github.com/dllrun/foam-extend-general-contact.git

2. (Install missing packages if any)
3. Adjust the ~/.bashrc file: 
- In the home directory, type 
  vim .bashrc
- (Set the environment variables if any)
- Set the path correctly
  alias switchToExtend='source $HOME/foam/foam-extend-4.0/etc/bashrc'

4. Source the .bashrc file
- Type,
  source .bashrc
  switchToExtend

5. Start Compilation
- Go to installation directory,
  cd foam/foam-extend-4.0/
  ./Allwmake

Note: foam-extend in windows 
i. If we want to use the foam-extend installed in windows directory,
- Always move the foam-extend in windows
- Never copy it to windows directory

ii. Changing the bashrc: 
- Make a change of relative path in the etc/bashrc file to 
  foamInstall=/mnt/c/Users/<yourUserName>/Documents/foam
- Source the bashrc file once again.
