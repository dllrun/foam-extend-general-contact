1. Introduction

The code is based on Finite Volume Method and it is forked from Unofficial-Extend-Project-Mirror/foam-extend-foam-extend-4.0. This library is an extension of the tools to predict deformation due to contact in solids. This includes the new tool for contact analysis in order to bridge the gap for multiple solids in contact. It also provides the coupling of the thermal contact boundary condition for one-to-one contact.
