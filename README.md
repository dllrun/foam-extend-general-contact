## 1. Introduction

This code repository is based on the Finite Volume Method and it is forked from 
Unofficial-Extend-Project-Mirror/foam-extend-foam-extend-4.0 (XXX). The improved code library "solidModel"
(XXX add link) is
an extension of the tools to predict deformation due to contact in solids. This 
includes the new tool (XXX which one?!?!) for contact analysis to allow the simulation of 
multiple solid bodies (e.g., particles) in contact. It also provides the coupling of the thermal 
contact boundary condition for one-to-one contacts (currently, no multiple solid bodies are allowed).

XXX detail on which solvers were improved
