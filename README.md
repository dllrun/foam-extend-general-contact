## 1. Introduction

The code is based on Finite Volume Method and it is forked from 
Unofficial-Extend-Project-Mirror/foam-extend-foam-extend-4.0. This library is 
an extension of the tools to predict deformation due to contact in solids. This 
includes the new tool for contact analysis in order to bridge the gap for 
multiple solids in contact. It also provides the coupling of the thermal 
contact boundary condition for one-to-one contact.
